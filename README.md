# Controller Connection demo
## Connect controllers via USB or Bluetooth
Can be one of the following controllers
  - Gamecube
  - PS4
  - Logitech USB
## Pick a controller using the radio buttons
Should be able to find one that works
## Test inputs!
Hopefully it works!

### Please if you want to add more controllers (compatibility) take a look in the webpage. 
There's an object containing indices of buttons, axes, and pads for future use.
If you want, you can expand on this project by adding more button data for more controllers.
